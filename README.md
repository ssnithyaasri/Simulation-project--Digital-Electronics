#NOR GATES

The NOR gate is a digital logic gate that implements logical NOR - it behaves according to thetruth table to the right. A HIGH output (1) results if both the inputs to the gate are LOW (0); if one or both input is HIGH (1), a LOW output (0) results. NOR is the result of the negation of the ORoperator. It can also in some senses be seen as the inverse of an AND gate. NOR is a functionallycomplete operationâ€”NOR gates can be combined to generate any other logical function. It shares this property with the NAND gate. By contrast, the OR operator is monotonic as it can only change LOW to HIGH but not vice versa.
